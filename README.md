# Encapsulating-User-Input
Write a program that contains a class to encapsulate a word that is entered by the user. An appropriate accessor method should be written and used. Write appropriate methods to do the following:

 1. Convert the word to all lowercase letters.
 2. Scramble the word into all possible permutations and store them in a list or array.
 3. Sort the permutations in alphabetical order.
 4. Display the list of permutations.
 5. Report the number of permutations.

Test all constructors and methods using a separate driver class.
